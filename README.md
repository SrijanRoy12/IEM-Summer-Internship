# IEM-Summer-Internship
üîç Trained or Used Models (Based on Project Description)
1. Pre-trained Foundation Models (Not Trained from Scratch):
GPT (e.g., GPT-4, GPT-3.5):

Used for planning, predictions, agent decision logic, report generation.

Likely not retrained but used through APIs (OpenAI, Azure, etc.).

DALL¬∑E / Sora / GenAI Visualization Models:

For generating city layouts, visual trend maps, emergency simulations.

Also likely not trained in your app but used via prompts (generative image/video outputs).

2. Agentic AI Frameworks (AutoGen / CrewAI):
These do not train models themselves, but rather orchestrate tasks between agents using LLMs and rules.

Each agent operates via role-based prompts and memory/context sharing ‚Äî no separate ML training happens here unless extended.

3. Custom-Trained (Optional) Models (If Implemented):
You might have trained or fine-tuned models like:

‚úÖ Traffic Congestion Predictor (e.g., Regression, LSTM, or XGBoost using real-time data)

‚úÖ Pollution Level Forecaster (Time-series or statistical models)

‚úÖ Energy Demand Predictor (Multivariate forecasting)

‚úÖ Emergency Incident Classifier (Could be ML-based using past incident data)
